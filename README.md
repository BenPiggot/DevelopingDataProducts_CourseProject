Developing Data Products Course Project
====================================
This repository contains files associated with the creation of a shiny app as part of the Developing Data Products class in the Johns Hopkins University Coursera Data Science Specialization. The shiny app provides a visual interface measuring the relationship between success in the German Bundelsiga soccer league (as measured in Wins) and Transfer Spending, Transfer Income, Goals Scored, and Goals Conceded between 1990 and 2010.

You can access the app at https://benpiggot.shinyapps.io/bundesliga-app/. You can also view a R presentation that presents a more thorough overview of the app's purpose at http://rpubs.com/BenPiggot/34095.
